# 🏗️ Hustler Architecture

## Objective
**Purpose:** Cascading Product Discovery. The Hustler pipeline is the **product-discovery and requirements engine** of the Agentic OS. It ingests raw market signals (videos, articles, screenshots, PDFs, scraped pages), cascades them through a Focus → Product → Feature hierarchy, processes them into structured definitions and needs, and surfaces validated product opportunities ready for monetization.

> **No separate Gateway runbook by design.** Unlike the Scaler (which uses `Scaler-Gateway.md` to gate every output through a Proposal/Internal Action card), the Hustler's gating mechanism IS the cascade itself — threshold checks at Focus / Product / Feature levels. Self-evolution of the Hustler runbooks flows OUT via the Scaler `INTERNAL` pipeline (see `Hustler-Operational-Rules.md` §5).

---

## 1. Pipeline Execution Layers

The Hustler pipeline strictly utilizes the global "Always-On" top-layer alongside localized pipeline layers:

### Global Always-On Layers (used for EVERY task)
- `meta_identity/`: Core identity, routing rules, and execution flow (`.meta_brain/meta_identity/`).
- `meta_router.yaml`: Central nervous system maps — all execution paths start here.
- `CONTROLER.yaml`: High-level configuration, scope modes, and session tracking.
- `.meta_brain/milestones/`: Active session and goal operation tracking.
- `hustler_router.yaml`: The localized index inside `.hustler_brain/` — absolute pathfinder for the pipeline.
- `.meta_brain/toolboxes/`: Core agentic and extended capabilities. Use specific toolboxes for analytics, planning, content extraction.

### Localized Pipeline Layers (Mapped via meta_router)
- `hustler_runbooks/`: Operational rules, workflows, cascading logic, tagging system. Strictly read before any Hustler execution.
- `.hustler_runtime/`: Local execution environment, scratch files, and archive for the Hustler.
- `hustler_ledgers/`: Centralized tracking ledgers — state, master discoveries rollup, anti-duplication.

> **Lazy scaffolding (H12 closure).** A focus folder at the pipeline root starts as `.gitkeep` only. Its sub-trees (`[focus]-PRODUCTS.yaml`, `_[focus]-discovery/`, validated `[product]/` subfolders, `[feature]/` subfolders, `00-data/`, `01-requirements/`) are scaffolded **lazily** by the cascade engine as thresholds validate. An empty focus folder is the valid baseline state. The brain's per-focus split ledgers (`[focus].focus_ledger.yaml` + `[focus].sources_ledger.yaml`) exist BEFORE the focus is populated, so the rollup can already track the focus during Phase 2 cascade.

> **Note on the layout:** The validated focus folder lives **at the pipeline root** (sibling to `.hustler_brain/`). All Phase 3-5 build work happens here. Tracking lives separately in `.hustler_brain/hustler_ledgers/[focus].focus_ledger.yaml` (strategic) + `[focus].sources_ledger.yaml` (anti-duplication). The brain tracks; the root focus folder builds.

## 3. The Three-Tier Hierarchy: Focus → Product → Feature

### 3.1 Focus
A validated *market segment* worth pursuing. Created when raw signals consistently point to a coherent niche.
- Threshold: cascading discovery sees ≥ N (configurable per Hustler) signals matching the same proto-focus before validation.
- Example: `algerian-ecommerce/` represents the Algeria-region e-commerce market segment.

### 3.2 Product
A validated *deliverable concept* within a Focus. Created when signals within a Focus consistently point to a specific product idea.
- Threshold: ≥ N signals for the same product-shape inside an existing Focus.
- Example: `algerian-ecommerce/winning-product-finder/` would be a product idea inside that focus.

### 3.3 Feature
A validated *atomic capability* within a Product. The unit of execution work. Holds raw data (`00-data/`), extracted requirements (`01-requirements/`), and the per-feature tracker.
- Threshold: ≥ N signals for the same feature-shape inside an existing Product.
- Example: `winning-product-finder/facebook-ads-pixel-setup/` would be one feature.

## 4. The Tracker System

The system uses `.yaml` files at multiple levels (the original `.yalm` typo from v1.0 is corrected). Each tracker surfaces status tags so higher-level routers can detect work pending below.

| Tracker | Tracks | Surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| `.hustler_routing/hustler_ledgers.yaml` (auto-generated rollup) | All validated focuses + master aggregates | Total focuses/products/features counts, pending in `.hustler_mixed_inbox/` |
| `[focus]-PRODUCTS.yaml` (in focus folder at pipeline root) | All validated Products under a Focus | Focus-level tags; flags pending product validation |
| `[focus].focus_ledger.yaml` (in `.hustler_brain/hustler_ledgers/`) | Per-focus strategic rollup — products/features + market context | Products + features per focus, currency/language/delivery/payment context |
| `[focus].sources_ledger.yaml` (in `.hustler_brain/hustler_ledgers/`) | Per-focus anti-duplication tracker for inbound cascades | Content hashes of sources cascaded into the focus |
| `.hustler_mixed_inbox.ledger.yaml` | Items in `.hustler_mixed_inbox/` awaiting cascade | Pending count, cascaded count |
| `[product]-FEATURES.yaml` | All validated Features under a Product | Feature-level status tags `[new-def]`, `[new-needs]` |
| `[feature].yaml` | Feature-specific definitions, needs, tags | Item-level tags |

---

## 5. Brain ↔ Runtime ↔ Workspace Separation

| Layer | Purpose | Contains | Does NOT contain |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.hustler_brain/` | **Logic, routing, runbooks, ledgers** | Sync engines, contracts, runbooks, state, per-focus split ledgers | Active discoveries, scraped data, ephemeral files |
| `.hustler_runtime/` | **Ephemeral runtime** | `.hustler_archive/`, `.hustler_scratch/` | System rules, mission tracking, market data |
| `_HUSTLER-EXTERNAL_SOURCES/` | **Inbound holding** | Inboxes, typed discovery hubs, user-space zone | Validated focuses, build work |
| `[focus]/` (at pipeline root) | **Active build workspace** | Validated focus folder where products/features get built | System rules, raw inboxes, sync engines |

---

## 6. Lifecycle of a Source

```
1. User drops file in _HUSTLER-EXTERNAL_SOURCES/.hustler_mixed_inbox/
        ↓
2. .hustler_mixed_inbox.ledger.yaml records content hash (anti-duplication)
        ↓
3. Phase 1 Ingestion → Hustler reads source, prepares for cascade
        ↓
4. Phase 2 Cascading Discovery → Focus check → Product check → Feature check
        ↓
5. Source lands in [focus]/[product]/[feature]/00-data/ tagged [new-data]
        (validated focus folder lives at pipeline root)
        ↓
6. Phase 3 Definition → [new-data] → [new-def] in [feature].yaml
        ↓
7. Phase 4 Needs Fulfillment → [new-def] → [new-needs] → assets in 01-requirements/
        ↓
8. Phase 5 Productization → validated feature → ready for monetization
```

Full phase logic lives in `Hustler-Workflows.md`. Cascading rules in `Hustler-Cascading-Logic.md`. Tag transitions in `Hustler-Tagging-System.md`.

## 7. Tracker Schemas (H5 closure)

When the cascade engine validates a Focus / Product / Feature and creates its tracker, it MUST produce these exact YAML shapes. The Hustler-Cascading-Logic.md §6 promotion procedure references this section as the canonical schema source.

### 7.1 `[focus]-PRODUCTS.yaml` — Focus-level tracker
Lives at the focus folder root: `_pipelines/hustler/[focus]/[focus]-PRODUCTS.yaml`.

```yaml
name: [focus_id]_products
metadata:
  type: focus_products
  focus_id: [focus_id]
  description: "Focus-level tracker of all products under [focus_id]."
  schema_version: "1.0"
  last_updated: "<ISO 8601>"

state:
  tracked_products:
    - product_id: [product-name]
      status: PENDING | VALIDATED | RETIRED
      created_at: "<ISO 8601>"
      validated_at: "<ISO 8601>"  # null if not yet validated
      sources_count: <int>         # how many cascaded signals support this product
      tags: []                     # propagated feature-level tags ([new-def], [new-needs])
  history: []                      # retired products
  summary:
    total: 0
    pending: 0
    validated: 0
```

### 7.2 `[product]-FEATURES.yaml` — Product-level tracker
Lives at the product folder root: `_pipelines/hustler/[focus]/[product]/[product]-FEATURES.yaml`.

```yaml
name: [product_id]_features
metadata:
  type: product_features
  focus_id: [focus_id]
  product_id: [product_id]
  description: "Product-level tracker of all features under [product_id]."
  schema_version: "1.0"
  last_updated: "<ISO 8601>"

state:
  tracked_features:
    - feature_id: [feature-name]
      status: PENDING | VALIDATED | RETIRED
      created_at: "<ISO 8601>"
      validated_at: "<ISO 8601>"
      sources_count: <int>
      tags: []                     # [new-def] | [new-needs] | (no tag = validated)
      data_files_count: <int>      # raw items in 00-data/
      requirements_count: <int>    # assets in 01-requirements/
  history: []
  summary:
    total: 0
    pending: 0
    validated: 0
    has_new_def: 0                 # features with active [new-def] tags
    has_new_needs: 0               # features with active [new-needs] tags
```

### 7.3 `[feature].yaml` — Feature-level tracker
Lives at the feature folder root: `_pipelines/hustler/[focus]/[product]/[feature]/[feature].yaml`.

```yaml
name: [feature_id]
metadata:
  type: feature
  focus_id: [focus_id]
  product_id: [product_id]
  feature_id: [feature_id]
  description: "<concise feature description, set on validation>"
  schema_version: "1.0"
  last_updated: "<ISO 8601>"

definitions:
  - def_id: def-001
    text: "<the definition body>"
    tag: "[new-def]"               # transitions to no-tag when needs fulfilled
    derived_from: ["00-data/<file1>", "00-data/<file2>"]
    created_at: "<ISO 8601>"

needs:
  - need_id: need-001
    def_id: def-001
    text: "<what logic/tools/knowledge this need requires>"
    tag: "[new-needs]"             # transitions to no-tag when fulfilled
    fulfillment:
      kind: EXTRACT | SCRAPE | EXTERNAL_TOOL
      source_files: ["00-data/<processed-data-file>"]   # for EXTRACT
      scraped_files: ["00-data/<new-scraped-file>"]      # for SCRAPE (Data Gap path)
      requirement_assets: ["01-requirements/<asset>"]    # output of fulfillment
    created_at: "<ISO 8601>"

data_inventory:                    # mirrored summary of 00-data/ for fast scan
  - file: "00-data/<filename>"
    tag: "[new-data]" | "[processed-data]" | "[new-scraped]"
    scraped_for: "need-XXX"        # only for [new-scraped] files (provenance)
    last_status_change: "<ISO 8601>"

status_summary:
  has_new_data: 0
  has_processed_data: 0
  has_new_scraped: 0
  has_new_def: 0
  has_new_needs: 0
  productization_ready: false      # true when all needs have no tag and 01-requirements/ is populated
```

### 7.4 Atomic Update Cross-Reference
Per H-LAW-006 (Atomic Tracker Update), a single cascade or processing operation touches multiple trackers in one transaction:

| Operation | Trackers updated atomically |
|---|---|
| Cascade source into existing feature | `.hustler_mixed_inbox.ledger.yaml` (or `[focus].sources_ledger.yaml`) → `[feature].yaml.data_inventory` → `[product]-FEATURES.yaml.state.tracked_features[].data_files_count` |
| Validate new Focus | `.hustler_mixed_inbox.ledger.yaml` → CREATE `[focus]/`, `[focus]-PRODUCTS.yaml`, `[focus].focus_ledger.yaml`, `[focus].sources_ledger.yaml` |
| Validate new Product under existing Focus | `[focus].sources_ledger.yaml` → CREATE `[focus]/[product]/`, `[product]-FEATURES.yaml` → `[focus]-PRODUCTS.yaml.state.tracked_products` → `[focus].focus_ledger.yaml.state.tracked_products` |
| Validate new Feature under existing Product | source ledger → CREATE `[feature]/`, `[feature].yaml`, `00-data/`, `01-requirements/` → `[product]-FEATURES.yaml.state.tracked_features` → `[focus].focus_ledger.yaml.state.tracked_features` |
| Phase 3 Definition tag transition | `[feature].yaml.definitions[].tag: [new-def]` → `[product]-FEATURES.yaml.state.tracked_features[].tags` → tag rewrite on the source file in `00-data/` ([new-data]→[processed-data]) |
| Phase 4 Step 4.1 needs creation | `[feature].yaml.needs[]` + tag bump on definition + `[product]-FEATURES.yaml.state.tracked_features[].tags` |
| Phase 4 Step 4.2 fulfillment | `[feature].yaml.needs[].fulfillment` → asset moved/extracted into `01-requirements/` → `[product]-FEATURES.yaml.state.tracked_features[].requirements_count` |

Any operation that fails mid-transaction MUST follow the recovery procedure documented in `Hustler-Operational-Rules.md` after H-LAW-006.
